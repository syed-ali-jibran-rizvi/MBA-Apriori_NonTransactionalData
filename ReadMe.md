# Demerits of Apriori: A Market Basket Analysis Approach

## Overview

In this project, the **Apriori algorithm** was applied to a dataset containing product attributes from an e-commerce platform to explore its utility for **Market Basket Analysis (MBA)**. The dataset consists of product details such as `name`, `main_category`, `sub_category`, `ratings`, `no_of_ratings`, `discount_price`, and `actual_price`. The goal was to discover useful **association rules** and **frequent itemsets** from these attributes, aiming to find relationships or patterns among the products that could help improve business strategies.

However, the results of applying the Apriori algorithm were not as expected or meaningful for the problem at hand. This readme aims to explain why this approach was chosen, the limitations of using Apriori with non-transactional data, and how the results failed to meet the requirements of a Market Basket Analysis.

## Dataset Description

The dataset used for this analysis includes product-level attributes:

- **name**: Product name
- **main_category**: Category of the product (e.g., `tv, audio & cameras`)
- **sub_category**: Subcategory (e.g., `All Electronics`)
- **ratings**: Customer ratings (range from 0 to 5)
- **no_of_ratings**: The total number of ratings for the product
- **discount_price**: Discounted price of the product
- **actual_price**: Original price of the product

### Data Preprocessing

Before applying the Apriori algorithm, the data underwent several preprocessing steps:

1. **Binary Transformation**: Non-binary features such as `ratings` and `discount_price` were transformed into binary categories. Ratings above the mean value were marked as 1 (indicating positive ratings), and ratings below the mean were marked as 0 (indicating negative or neutral ratings). Similarly, `discount_price` values were transformed into binary categories based on whether they were above or below the mean price.
   
2. **Creation of Transactional Data**: Each row in the dataset was treated as a separate transaction. The goal was to convert product attributes (like category and price) into a format suitable for the Apriori algorithm, even though this data was not inherently transactional.

## Why Apriori on Non-Transactional Data?

The decision to apply Apriori on non-transactional data was motivated by the goal to explore how product attributes (such as `ratings`, `discount_price`, and `main_category`) could reveal patterns or associations when treated like transactions. While Apriori is traditionally applied to transactional data (e.g., items bought together), we hoped that using binary representations of product features would allow us to identify associations between different product attributes.

The idea behind this approach was that products with similar `main_category`, `rating_category`, or pricing behavior might frequently "co-occur" in the dataset, even though they weren't explicitly part of the same transaction. This is an unconventional use of the Apriori algorithm, but it was an attempt to explore potential relationships within product attributes that could still yield valuable insights for **Market Basket Analysis (MBA)**.

## Results of Applying Apriori

The **frequent itemsets** and **association rules** generated by the Apriori algorithm are as follows:

- **Frequent Itemsets**:
   - Main categories (e.g., `tv, audio & cameras`) were frequently associated with subcategories like `All Electronics`.
   - Products with high ratings (marked as 1 in `rating_category`) were found to frequently occur with products in the same category.
   - The support values of some itemsets were very high, indicating a near-perfect match for certain combinations of attributes (e.g., `main_category_tv, audio & cameras` → `sub_category_All Electronics` with 100% support).

- **Association Rules**:
   - The rules were expressed as relationships like:
     - `main_category_tv, audio & cameras -> sub_category_All Electronics`
     - `rating_category_1 -> main_category_tv, audio & cameras`
   - Confidence values for these rules were generally high (around 1.0), indicating that the associations between product categories and ratings were almost always true in the dataset.

However, despite these findings, the results did not meet the expectations of a traditional **Market Basket Analysis**:

1. **Lack of Transactional Context**: The most significant issue with the results was that the data was **not transactional** in nature. The Apriori algorithm works best when it can analyze transactions of items bought together. Here, we tried to apply it to individual product attributes, which led to associations that were more about **attribute co-occurrence** rather than meaningful product groupings based on real-world transactions.
   
2. **Over-Simplified Results**: The binary transformations of continuous variables (e.g., ratings and prices) led to overly simplistic and possibly **misleading** results. The association rules generated were often trivial and did not provide valuable insights that could help in identifying actual buying patterns.
   
3. **Limited Practicality**: The identified itemsets and rules were not actionable in the context of business decision-making. For example, knowing that `rating_category_1` is associated with the `main_category_tv, audio & cameras` doesn't provide any useful information about what products should be marketed together or recommended.

## Why the Results Are Not Useful

1. **The Data Was Not Transactional**: Applying Apriori on a dataset that does not represent transactional data (like product purchases) leads to a mismatch in the type of analysis Apriori is designed for. The algorithm assumes that the itemsets represent items bought together, which was not the case here. As a result, the patterns discovered were superficial and lacked real-world relevance.
   
2. **Data Transformation Issues**: Transforming continuous data into binary values removed the rich context needed to understand the relationships between product features. For instance, transforming `discount_price` into binary values based on the mean price eliminated the nuance of the actual pricing structure, making it harder to discover meaningful price-related patterns.

3. **Lack of Real-World Insights**: The frequent itemsets and association rules produced were not actionable. They mostly captured correlations between product attributes (e.g., categories and ratings) without providing insights that could help businesses with strategic decisions like bundling, promotions, or targeted marketing.

## Recommendations

1. **Use Transactional Data**: To make the Apriori algorithm meaningful, it's essential to have **transactional data**—data that includes combinations of products bought together. A dataset where each row represents a unique transaction would be much more suitable for Apriori, helping to reveal useful associations between products purchased in the same transaction.

2. **Alternative Algorithms**: Since our dataset is product-based and not transactional, exploring other types of analysis (such as **collaborative filtering** for recommendations, or **classification** for predicting product categories) might yield more meaningful results.

3. **Refining Data Transformation**: If you still want to use Apriori on your current dataset, consider using more refined transformations. Instead of binary encoding, you might want to preserve the actual values (like ratings and prices) and apply a more advanced form of clustering or segmentation.

## Conclusion

While Apriori is a powerful algorithm for **Market Basket Analysis**, its application on **non-transactional data** like the one in this project led to unsatisfactory and trivial results. The lack of transactional context, combined with overly simplified binary transformations, made the patterns discovered by the algorithm not meaningful or actionable in a business context. For future analysis, using proper transactional data and more suitable algorithms would likely yield better insights and more valuable business recommendations.
